# WebUntis Apple Shortcut Integration

I have created an Apple Shortcut automation that allows you to quickly ask Siri when school starts the next day.

By utilizing the WebUntis API, this shortcut retrieves the start time of your first period from your personal timetable in your WebUntis account.

    1. Download the shortcut file to your Apple device by clicking the download button below.
    2. Open the file in the Shortcuts app to add it to your automations.
    3. Enter your login data (username and password) into the shortcut.
    4. Run the automation by tapping it or asking Siri.
